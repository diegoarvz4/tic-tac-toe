## Rules of the Game

Tic tac toe is 2-player turn-based board game where the goal is that only each of one of the players can make 3-in-a-row (vertical, horizontal or diagonal). 

First, is decided who is going to start. In this case, the program will decide it randomly. 

After that, you must place your token (either 'x' or 'o') in the board with the 'xy' format where x is the row and y is the column. 

Finally, if nobody was able to make any 3-in-a-row and the are no avialable spaces to play anymore, the program will declare a tie.

Enjoy the game!
